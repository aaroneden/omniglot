# Our Vision
To break down communication barriers globally, creating a world where language is no longer a barrier to understanding, connection, and collaboration. By harnessing advanced AI and machine learning technologies, Omniglot aims to empower individuals to communicate effortlessly in any language in real time, fostering a truly global community. 

To accomplish this vision we will build a real-time translation platform based on Meta's Seamless family of models.  Additionally, we will build:
1. A portable device that can allow in-person translations during our events
2. A Zoom or Google meet plug-in to allow virtual translations for our online events
